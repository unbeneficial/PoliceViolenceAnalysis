# PoliceViolenceAnalysis

## Intro
This is an analysis of police shootings around the United States from 2010 to 2016
The goal of this project is to analyze statistics on police shootings and construct visual representations which allow us to better understand how various factors correlate with incident outcome (fatal vs. not fatal)
I will be focusing on the interactions between suspectsâ€™ age, race, and status of armament along with the race and number of officers present.

## Conclusions: 
### Gender: 
The density ridges plot shows that female suspects are far less likely than male suspects to be shot at in an incident with the police. Additionally, in this dataset, only Black women had incidents with the police. 
### Race: 
For male suspects, all races had similar numbers of shots fired at them, but Asian men were least likely to be killed by the police. Additionally, in one on one incidents, having the suspect and officer be of the same race led to less shots fired and less fatalities for suspects of all races. 
### Age: 
On average more officers are likely to be sent to cases where the suspect is between 30-65 years old. With the least number of officers responding to incidents where the suspect was under 20 or over 70.

## Limitations: 
One limitation was sample size. After removing incomplete entries, there are only 78 incidents in the dataset where the suspect was female. Similarly there were only 33 incidents with Asian suspects. These are small sample sizes which can skew statistics. Also, nearly all of the incidents come from major police jurisdictions in or near urban centers. Thus, this data can not be used to draw conclusions about suburban or dual policing
